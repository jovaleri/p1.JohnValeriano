## Intro
    Microwaves, everybody has them and everybody has used them. It may be to make some popcorn
    or heat up that leftover spaghetti you made a few days ago. But something has been consistent 
    in these machines since, and that is its user interface. 

## Factors For a Good Interface 
* Easy to read numbers\letters
* Minimal Interactions 
* Tactile 
* Intuitive

## Examples

## In-Person Microwave 
### My Microwave

### First Interaction
![Interaction1](https://github.com/jovaleri/p1.JohnValeriano/blob/main/images/gif1.gif)

    In this gif, the number 5 button is not responding, in addition to this, the button also isn't tactile meaning that 
    you can't tell if you pressed the button or not.

### Second Interaction 
![Interaction2](https://github.com/jovaleri/p1.JohnValeriano/blob/main/images/gif2.gif)

    In this gif, when inputting the time, numbers between 1-6 will automatically start the timer depending on the number clicked
    , which is inconvenient because some people want to input a specific time without having to press the "Pre-set" button. 

### Critique
![Analysis](https://github.com/jovaleri/p1.JohnValeriano/blob/main/images/3.png)

### Does the given UI make it easier to use? 

    Absolutely not, this interface is very confusing! There are a lot of ways to improve this design. From my experience, uses for the microwave are only used for: 

* Heating up Food (Pasta, Pizza, etc.)
* Heating up Water
* Mac & Cheese
* Pop-Corn
* Cup Ramens 


## Improvements

    When users are interacting with a microwave, they're just there to heat up something or "cook" something. All the other buttons, features, is
    too much, it serves no purpose but to make the microwave seem to be full of features, but it only will confuse the user more. When people use the microwave
    , they do a specific set of actions: 
    
1. Put the item inside the microwave. 
2. Input the time needed to heat or cook
3. Wait
4. Take out item

    The only different factors here are the time it takes as well as the amount of power needed to heat up or cook an item. 

    The best way to make this very understandable as well as easy to user for anyone is to reduce the amount of buttons and make it very intuivitive to use. 

    So, something like using knobs that lets the user control the time as well as the wattage power is optimal here. Users only have to worry about two things
    to control. However, a screen is also useful to inform the user the remaining time, warn them if they need to close the door, if their food is done, etc. 


### What about Touch Screens?

    As cool as touch screens are and how futuristic they look, they serve problems as well, this may attract younger and "tech-savvy" users, but for older audiences, it's like
    using their kid's new iPhone all over again!
